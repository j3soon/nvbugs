**Synopsis**: [Isaac][2020.2][X86|Jetson]: Bug in ZedCamera package code

**Description**:
The details are mentioned here: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/bug-in-zedcamera-package-code/176433

I'm using Isaac SDK 2020.2.2.

Line 185-186 in `sdk/packages/zed/ZedCamera.cpp`:

    // This should be set for ZedImuReader to read the Zed-M and ZED 2 IMU data
    params.sensors_required = !get_enable_imu();

I think the `!get_enabled_imu()` here should be changed to `get_enabled_imu()` (without the not operator).

Currently, if I want to set the `sensors_required` to false, I need to set `enable_imu` to `true` in my config file, which is semantically incorrect.

**Module**: Isaac
