**Synopsis**: [Isaac][Omniverse][2022.1.0] ISAAC SIM setup_python_env.sh has incorrect `SCRIPT_DIR` variable

**Description**:

Anaconda users (https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_python.html#advanced-running-with-anaconda)
are not able to use the `python` command when cwd is not `~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.1.0`.

More specifically, with the following error: (For example when cwd is `~`)

```
$ python -c "import omni"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'omni'
```

Since all paths in `$PYTHONPATH` are being set to relative paths by `setup_python_env.sh`.

--------------------------------------------------

The issue arises from `~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.1.0/setup_python_env.sh`, where the variable `SCRIPT_DIR` is incorrectly defined as:

```
SCRIPT_DIR="$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE}")"
```

and should be changed to:

```
SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
```

After the change, all paths in `$PYTHONPATH` are made absolute. Anaconda users can use the `python` command anywhere.

--------------------------------------------------

This issue can be reproduced in the minimal example below (`~/tmp/test.sh`):

```
#!/bin/bash
SCRIPT_DIR="$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE}")"
echo "$SCRIPT_DIR"

SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
echo "$SCRIPT_DIR"
```

and run it with:

```
$ cd ~/tmp
$ . ~/tmp/test.sh
.
/home/johnson/tmp
```

The incorrect `SCRIPT_DIR` outputs `.`, which means that it is a relative path.

--------------------------------------------------

Instead of only fixing this issue. I observed that there are 400+ files that may have similar issue by searching `BASH_SOURCE` under `~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.1.0/`. Maybe they can be fixed altogether?
