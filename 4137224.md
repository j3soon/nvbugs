**Synopsis**: [Isaac][Omniverse][2022.2.1] Isaac Sim Camera Coordinate System issue when creating camera through Python script

**Description**:

I'm working with camera coordinate system conversion in Isaac Sim, and came across the following code:

```py
# from USD camera convention to Isaac camera convention
I_U_TRANSFORM = np.array([[0, 0, -1, 0], [-1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]])

# from Isaac camera convention to USD camera convention
U_I_TRANSFORM = np.array([[0, -1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]])
```

located in: `~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.2.1/exts/omni.isaac.sensor/omni/isaac/sensor/scripts/camera.py`, and
in `~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.2.1/exts/omni.isaac.sensor/omni/isaac/sensor/scripts/lidar_rtx.py`.

I think the comments above are slightly confusing, since the USD and Isaac camera convention is equivalent:

- Isaac Sim Camera Axes:
  - Up: +Y
  - Right: +X
  - Forward: -Z
  - Reference: https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/reference_conventions.html
- USD Camera Axes:
  - Up: +Y
  - Right: +X
  - Forward: -Z
  - Reference: https://openusd.org/dev/api/usd_geom_page_front.html#UsdGeom_WindingOrder

As USD Matrices follow row-major order, the `U_I_TRANSFORM` actually transforms to the following Camera Axes:
- Up: +Z
- Right: -Y
- Forward: +X

I wonder if this is the intended behavior?

--------------------------------------------------

Some details:

- Isaac Sim World Axes:
  - Up: +Z
  - Right: -Y
  - Forward: +X
  - Reference: https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/reference_conventions.html
- Omniverse Create World Axes:
  - Up: +Y
  - Right: -X
  - Forward: +Z
- Omniverse New Camera Axes: (Created from UI, Rotate [0, 0, 0])
  - Up: +Y
  - Right: +X
  - Forward: -Z
- Isaac Sim New Camera Axes: (Created from UI, Orient [90, 90, 0])
  - Up: +Z
  - Right: +Y
  - Forward: -X
- Isaac Sim Zero-Orientation Camera Axes: (Orient [0, 0, 0])
  - Up: +Y
  - Right: +X
  - Forward: -Z
- Isaac Sim New Camera Sensor Axes: (Created from Script, Orient [90, -90, 0])
  - Up: +Z
  - Right: -Y
  - Forward: +X
- Isaac Sim Modified Camera Sensor Axes: (Modified `I_U_TRANSFORM` and `U_I_TRANSFORM` to Identity Matrix, Created from Script, Orient [0, 0, 0])
  - Up: +Y
  - Right: +X
  - Forward: -Z

Camera Sensor Creation Script:

```py
from omni.isaac.sensor import Camera
Camera(prim_path="/World/camera")
```

--------------------------------------------------

I suspect the intended behavior is to mimic the new camera axes created from UI, that is:
- Up: +Z
- Right: +Y
- Forward: -X

corresponding to:

```py
# from USD camera convention to Isaac camera convention
I_U_TRANSFORM = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]])

# from Isaac camera convention to USD camera convention
U_I_TRANSFORM = np.array([[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]])
```

which removes the negation of the axes.

The comments and variable names should also be fixed accordingly. (removing the mention of USD and the `U` in variable name to prevent confusions.)
