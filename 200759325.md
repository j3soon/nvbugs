**Synopsis**: [Isaac][Omniverse][2021.1.1] Difficulty on finding ISAAC SIM package directory

**Description**:

I'm using ISAAC SIM (Omniverse) 2021.1.1.

The major change from 2021.1.0 to 2021.1.1 ([Change Log Link](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/Isaac/omni_isaac_sim/-/releases)) is the removal of Linux binary (standalone) package. The standalone package can no longer be downloaded without internal GitLab access.

In 2021.1.0, the tools in ISAAC SIM package (e.g., python.sh) used in many samples ([Link 1](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/python_environment.html), [Link 2](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/sample_training_rl.html#isaac-sim-jetbot-lane-following), [Link 3](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/sample_dofbot.html#)) can be found directly in the standalone package. However, the 2021.1.1 release stores the directory in `~/.local/share/ov/package/isaac_sim-2021.1.1`, which is only mentioned once through out the entire documentation ([Link](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/user_interface_launcher.html#isaac-sim-app-launcher)). The path is very hard to find when migrating from 2021.1.0 to 2021.1.1.

Suggested Solutions:
1. In the beginning of the [Python Environment](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/python_environment.html) page, mention the package path (`~/.local/share/ov/package/isaac_sim-2021.1.1`) or link to [this page](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/user_interface_launcher.html#isaac-sim-app-launcher).
2. Mention the standalone package is removed in the [CHANGELOG](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/release_notes.html#open-beta), and direct users to the [Python Environment](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/python_environment.html) page to locate the package.
3. Make sure all examples using the Python package has a back link to the [Python Environment](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/python_environment.html) page. (e.g., the [DofBot example](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/sample_dofbot.html#mirroring-between-isaac-sim-s-dofbot-and-real-dofbot) didn't mention that the `IsaacSim_To_RealDofBot.ipynb` file is located in the [Python Environment](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/python_environment.html).)
