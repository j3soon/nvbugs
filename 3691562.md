**Synopsis**: [Isaac][Omniverse][2022.1.0] ISAAC SIM environment.yml has incorrect protobuf version

**Description**:

In Isaac Sim documentation, the `environment.yml` used in "4.5. Advanced: Running with Anaconda" have incorrect dependency versions.

This causes error when following the Isaac Gym tutorial: "3. Creating New RL Environment". (error message is in the end of this report)

More specifically, we should change `~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.1.0/environment.yml` from:

```
- pip:
  - stable-baselines3==1.2.0
  - tensorboard==2.4.0
  - tensorboard-plugin-wit==1.7.0
  - gym==0.20.0
```

to:

```
- pip:
  - stable-baselines3==1.2.0
  - tensorboard==2.4.0
  - tensorboard-plugin-wit==1.7.0
  - gym==0.20.0
  - protobuf==3.9.2
```

I think this error occurs due to forgetting to update `environment.yml`, since `requirements.txt` has the correct version.

To avoid such dependency errors in the future, a potential solution is to enforce the dependency versions of the three python options: `kit/python/python3`, `requirements.txt`, and `environment.yml`, before releasing a new version (maybe with an automated test to check this).

If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.
If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:
 1. Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.
 2. Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).
