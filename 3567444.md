**Synopsis**: Blender: Could not create reader for file

**Description**:

The issue is reproduced on 2 Windows 10 Machine, using Blender 3.1.0 with Hash: c77597cd0e15.
The issue occurs in multiple USD files, I only provide one of them for reproducibility.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Download the USD file (`BallGymnastic_202203.usd`) in the Google Drive link (requires NVIDIA account to access): https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sMv-fVNBDHz1q_z8_X1K5-xHREtuUYU/view?usp=sharing
2. Open Blender.
3. Select `File > Import > USD`, select the USD file, and click `Import USD`. (The animation can be played correctly)
4. Select `File > Save`, name it `untitled.blend`, and click `Save Blender File`.
5. Close Blender, and open a new instance.
6. Select `File > Open`, choose `untitled.blend`, and click `Open`. (The animation cannot be played)
7. Select `model_stw_anim_body_geoShape` by clicking the model, and view `Modifier Properties`. Observe the error: `Could not create reader for file //BallGymnastic_202203.usd`.
8. Select `File > New > General` and click `Don't Save`.
9. Re-import the USD file.
10. Observe the error: `USD Import: unable to open stage to read C:\Users\Johnson\Downloads\BallGymnastic_202203\BallGymnastic_202203.usd`.

**Hack for Opening the Blender File**:
1. Open Blender.
2. Import the USD file.
3. Select `File > New > General` and click `Don't Save`.
4. Open `untitled.blend`. (The animation can be played correctly)

**More Details**:
1. The model is provided by: https://www.animationmentor.com/free-maya-rig/
2. The animation is designed in Maya.
3. The USD file is exported from Maya.
4. The USD animation works well in Omniverse Create.

**Possible Causes**:
I believe it is due to USD information loss when saving an imported USD as a Blender file. Some hypothesis:
- Import USD file stores all information in memory, some information is lost when saving as Blender file.
- Open the Blender file causes the error due to some USD information is not present in memory.
- Import USD file stores all information in memory. These information is kept in memory even when opening a new file. Open the Blender file won't have errors since the required information is loaded into memory in the initial USD import.
